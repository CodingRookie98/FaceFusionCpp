FaceFusionCpp is a high-performance C++ rewrite of the popular open-source project [facefusion](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion). It aims to provide the same powerful face manipulation capabilities with significantly improved performance, lower resource usage, and easier deployment.

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚡ High Performance**: Optimized C++ core with multi-threading support for maximum throughput.
- **🚀 Hardware Acceleration**: Native CUDA and TensorRT integration for lightning-fast inference.
- **🛠 Comprehensive Toolset**:
  - **Face Swapping**: Swap faces in images and videos with high fidelity.
  - **Face Enhancement**: Restore and sharpen facial details.
  - **Expression Restoration**: Recover original facial expressions.
  - **Super Resolution**: Upscale low-resolution images and videos.
- **📦 Batch Processing**: Efficiently handle mixed inputs of images and videos.
- **🔧 Cross-Platform**: Full support for **Windows x64** and **Linux x64**.
